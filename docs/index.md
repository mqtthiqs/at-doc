# GRM Tools Atelier

_Tagline_: Creative Audio Workbench

## Patch, play, discover

_Atelier_ is a sandbox for the curious, a platform for exploring endless sonic ideas. Modular at its
core, multichannel from the ground up, it is the modern tool for all sound adventurers. _Atelier_
doesn't hand you the sound: it gives you everything you need to uncover it yourself.

Standing on decades of research in audio signal processing and electronic lutherie, _Atelier_ is the
new software platform of the GRM Tools series, coming straight from INA GRM's research & development
department and developed in close connection with GRM's avant-garde composers and sound designers.

## What's in the box

_Atelier_ is a standalone application and a plugin for DAWs (VST3, AUv2, AAX) for macOS. It
comprises a set of _modules_, which are freely chainable and connectible:

* the _processors_, which generate or transform (multichannel) sound, and
* the _modulators_, which generate (polyadic) modulations, freely assignable to any parameter

## Features

* _Polyadic Modulation Engine_: A novel modulation paradigm: organic and per-voice control, making
  it fast and expressive to build complex, evolving patches.
* _Full Multichannel Support_: Create in stereo, quad, or 64+ channels without changing how you
  work. Perfect for spatial composition.
* _Simple yet groundbreaking modules_: From granular delays to multi-playhead samplers, modules are
  simple and understandable, yet reward curiosity and creative misuse.
* _Hybrid Workflow_: Sound generation and processing in one place; build an advanced synth, a
  granular FX chain, or something never seen before.
* _Sound Morphing_: Transition between module presets with smooth sonic interpolation, ideal for
  performance or evolving textures.

## Philosophy

* _By musicians, for musicians_: Like you, we are all passionate musicians, and GRM welcomes
  resident avant-garde electronic music composers with whom we exchange every day. _Atelier_ was
  built with a single purpose: be the tool we are lacking. No market considerations, no revenue
  goals: all decisions taken by musicians, for musicians.
* _The magic is in the making_: true to Pierre Schaeffer's founding principles of composing by
  directly interacting with the musical material ("Le faire et l'entendre"), everything in Atelier
  is real-time, interactive and modulatable: no planning required; just be guided by what you hear.
* _Just tools_: Every module has simple and easy to understand functions: everything is observable
  and documented, nothing is a black box. Just by playing, you will learn how things work, and
  discover new uses for the tools. Play it simple or build something complex; we are just giving you
  the tools to do so.
* _Classics, reinvented_: Atelier is a reinvention of the venerable GRM Tools 3 suite: while
  respecting and preserving the underlying philosophy, it bears no single line of code in common
  with its older sibling.

## The beginning of a beautiful friendship
