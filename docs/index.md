# Atelier

_Creative Audio Workbench_

## Patch, play, discover

_Atelier_ is a sandbox for the curious, a platform for exploring endless sonic ideas. Modular at its
core, multichannel from the ground up, it is the modern tool for all sound adventurers. _Atelier_
doesn't hand you the sound: it gives you everything you need to uncover it yourself.

Standing on decades of research in audio signal processing and electronic lutherie, _Atelier_ is the
new software platform of the GRM Tools series, coming straight from INA GRM's research & development
department and developed in close connection with GRM's avant-garde composers and sound designers.

## What's in the box

_Atelier_ is a standalone application and a plugin for DAWs (VST3, AUv2, AAX) for macOS (Windows
support coming in 2026). It comprises a set of _modules_, which are freely chainable and
connectible:

* **Processors** which generate or transform (multichannel) sound, and
* **Modulators** which generate (polyadic) modulations, freely assignable to any parameter

## Features

* **Polyadic Modulation Engine:** A novel modulation paradigm: organic and per-voice control, making
  it fast and expressive to build complex, evolving patches.
* **Full Multichannel Support:** Create in stereo, quad, or 64+ channels without changing how you
  work. Perfect for spatial composition.
* **Groundbreaking yet simple modules:** From granular delays to multi-playhead samplers, modules
  are simple and understandable, yet reward curiosity and creative misuse.
* **Hybrid Workflow:** Sound generation and processing in one place; build an advanced synth, a
  granular FX chain, or something never seen before.
* **Sound Morphing:** Transition between module presets or randomize parameters with smooth sonic
  interpolation, ideal for performance, evolving patches or to be surprise.

## Philosophy

* **By musicians, for musicians:** Like you, we are all passionate musicians, and GRM welcomes
  resident avant-garde electronic music composers with whom we exchange every day. _Atelier_ was
  built with a single purpose: be the tool we are lacking. No market considerations, no revenue
  goals: all decisions taken by musicians, for musicians.
* **The magic is in the making:** true to Pierre Schaeffer's founding principles of composing by
  directly interacting with the musical material ("Le faire et l'entendre"), everything in _Atelier_
  is real-time, interactive and modulatable: no planning required; just be guided by what you hear.
* **Just tools:** Every module has simple and easy to understand functions: everything is observable
  and documented, nothing is a black box. Just by playing, you will learn how things work, and
  discover new uses for the tools. Play it simple or build something complex; we are just giving you
  the tools to do so.
* **Classics, reinvented:** _Atelier_ is a reinvention of the venerable GRM Tools 3 suite: while
  respecting and preserving the underlying philosophy, it bears no single line of code in common
  with its older sibling.

## The beginning of a beautiful friendship

_Atelier_ is built to grow. As we develop new features it will evolve over time, including new
modules, processors and modulators, and new core features. Your purchase of _Atelier_ `v1.x` is a
lifetime purchase: no subscription, no recurring fees. It includes all features that will be
introduced in point-updates, i.e. about 1.5â€”2 years worth of upgrades. When `v2.0` is released, we
will propose discounted upgrade paths for existing `v1.x` user.
