# GRM Tools Atelier

_[Work in progress]_

_Atelier_ is a sandbox for the curious, a platform for exploring endless sonic ideas. Modular at its
core, multichannel from the ground up, it is a tool that doesn't hand you the sound, but gives you
everything you need to uncover it yourself.

Standing on decades of research in audio signal processing and electronic lutherie, and in close
connection with avant-garde composers and sound designers, _Atelier_ is the new software platform of
the GRM Tools series, coming straight from INA GRM's research & development department.

## Features

* _Polyadic Modulation Engine_: A novel modulation paradigm: organic and per-voice control, making
  it fast and expressive to build complex, evolving patches.
* _Full Multichannel Support_: Create in stereo, quad, or 64+ channels without changing how you
  work. Perfect for spatial composition.
* _Simple yet groundbreaking modules_: From granular delays to multi-playhead samplers, modules are
  simple and understandable, yet reward curiosity and creative misuse.
* _Hybrid Workflow_: Sound generation and processing in one place; build an advanced synth, a
  granular FX chain, or something never seen before.
* _Sound Morphing_: Transition between module presets with smooth sonic interpolation, ideal for
  performance or evolving textures.

## What's in the box

_Atelier_ is a standalone application and a plugin for DAWs (VST3, AUv2, AAX) for macOS. It
comprises a set of _modules_, which are freely chainable and connectible:

* the _processors_, which generate or transform multichannel sound, and
* the _modulators_, which generate polyadic modulation signals freely assignable to any parameter

## The beginning of a beautiful friendship

_Atelier_ is built to grow. As we develop new features it will evolve over time, including new
modules, processors and modulators, and new core features.
