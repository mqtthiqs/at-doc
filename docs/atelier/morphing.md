# Morphing

!!! warning "This section is a **work in progress**"

<!-- physical world: state transitions? -->
<!-- continuous transition between parameter states -->
<!-- one control (morph time) to rule them all -->
<!--   snapshots, random and elastic -->
<!-- once a morph is on the way it cannot be stopped -->
<!--   create a very long morph and shorter sub-morphs in between -->
<!--   params modified manual during morph stay where they are -->

## Module snapshots

<!-- preloaded with examples -->
<!-- what's part, what not? -->
<!--    cursor activation -->
<!--    not modulations or modulation amount -->
<!-- storing snapshots, recalling (blinking) -->
<!-- stored in patch (note: currently no way to export snapshots but planned) -->
<!-- reset to initials? -->
<!-- modulatable like anything else -->

## Randomizer

<!-- randomization amount -->
<!-- randomizing whole patches -->
<!-- randomizing modules -->
<!-- what's part, what not? -->
<!--    not cursor activation -->
<!--    nor modulations or modulation amount -->
<!-- randomizing parameters -->

## Locking

<!-- what's locking for -->
<!-- locking modules -->
<!-- locking parameters -->
<!-- locking groups -->
