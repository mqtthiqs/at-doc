# Multichannel processing

!!! warning "This section is a **work in progress**"

Multichannel processing is part of _GRM Tools Atelier_'s core DNA. From its inception a flexible and adaptive performance in multi channel environments was one of the key design considerations. You can as easily compose for stereo setups as for quadrophony, octophony or 64+ channels. Even in a standard stereo setup _Atelier_'s unique design choices will by default produce outputs with wider stereo images than comparable tools.

A patch produced in one environment will automatically scale to fit any other setup. This adaptability holds precedence over surgical operations on a particular channel in a particular setup. [...] Plenty of high-quality tools are available to mix discrete channels into a particular surround format.

## Features

- Over 64 input and output channels
- Automatic adoption of a patch created on one setup to a new environment
- Wide stereo images and movement in channels by design rather than as a mixing afterthought
- Simple, efficient and easy to understand algorithm to distribute processing and input channels (?)

## Multichannel processing in modules

Whenever you add a tone generator or a processor in a module it will have one or more channels assigned to it. Let's say you have four cursors in [Comb](../modules/comb.md)

- philosophy
  - limits (or lack thereof)
  - automatic adoption of patches to current setup
    - rather than surgical operation on channels that make sense only in the context of
      current setup
  - perfect for spacial composition
  - context: acousmonium?
  - discrete vs. surround format

  - fanning & folding
  - spread
- # of channels match # of output channels
  - settings in standalone
  - as a plugin: adjusts to track layout as setup in DAW
