## Where is my configuration stored?

The app audio configuration, recent files and last loaded patch are stored in a hidden file in your
`Application Support` directory. In case you need to delete it, back it up or restore it:

- Open a Finder window
- In the "_Go_" menu, select "_Go to folder..._" or type ⇧-⌘-G
- In the popup, enter `~/Library/Application Support/`
- The configuration `com.INAgrm.GRMTools.Atelier.settings`

## I customized my module presets, but they disappeared after starting a new patch

Module presets are saved and can be different for each instances of each module. There is no way to
save (yet). Do reach out if you think it would be useful to you.

## Presets morphing is cool, but where do I set the morph time?

The _Morph Time_ slider is in the drawer on the right. It controls preset morphing and elastic
moves.
