_Time_ is a delay unlike any other. It an exploration of how far the concept of a delay can be
pushed into uncharted territories. In its simplest form, it takes audio as input, stores it in a
buffer and replays it a while later. But with up to 32 freely-tunable taps, variable transport
speed, continuous granular playback and per-tap band-pass filters, it can reach sound
transformations yet unheard of. _Time_ is the ace of spades of time-domain operations.

## Features

- freely-tunable delay with multiple tap. Up to 32 taps, from milliseconds to minutes.
- per-tap resonant band-pass filter
- variable-rate read/write speed
- continuous control of repitching vs. granular (crossfading) playback

## Context

From the advent of magnetic tape to digital storage, using the medium as short-term storage for
sound is an infinite source of sound manipulations.

In the late 1950s, GRM started producing a series of revolutionary tape-playing machines used as
sound processing instruments, [the _Phonog√®nes_ and
_Morphophones_](https://sites.inagrm.com/grmstudio/activities/Historique_Manipulations.xhtml). Using
complex pulley mechanisms and read-head drums, they could read small chunks of tapes at speeds
independent of the tape transport, inventing the granular playback techniques that still power pitch
shifting and time stretching algorithms nowadays. Using multiple read heads, arbitrarily placed on
the tape and filtered indepedently, they could break free from the repetition of the simple feedback
loop, radically transforming input sound material.

_Time_ takes up where these machines left off, maintaining the tape analogy that makes things
logical and easy to understand. At its heart, _Time_ provides a large audio buffer, which the
module's input is continuously written to. At any point in this buffer, one can place a read head (a
_tap_), that reads the written material with a delay. The speed at which this buffer goes by is
variable (**Speed**); like tape, the slower the speed the more delay, and the more the signal is
degraded: there are less samples to record a given audio chunk.

Each tap is actually made of two read heads quickly relaying each other in reading the audio at
their position (granular playback). Therefore, if the delay time is changed, it smoothly crossfades
to the new position without clicks or repitches. In fact, and contrarily to usual delays, this
crossfade time is freely settable (**Repitch/Fade:**), allowing for repitches, crossfades and a
wealth of interesting in-betweens.

Just like on the Morphophone, each tap then goes to a band-pass filter (**Bandpass**) which resonant
frequency can be set (**Cutoff**), and is then summed to the output. The feedback loop
(**Feedback**) reinjects this sum back into the input, resulting in potentially complex impulse
responses and reverberation-resonator-delay hybrids.

## Controls

### Cursor area

Click to add a tap; double-click a tap to remove it. Each tap reads from the same audio buffer at
different delay times; it is then band-pass-filtered indepently and summed to the output and to the
feedback path.

- **Clear audio buffer:** instantly clears all audio material in the buffer.
- **Y axis parameter:** The combo box determines which parameter is displayed on the Y axis (and
  consequently which is displayed on the Z axis, ie. cursors' halo size): either **Gain** or
  **Cutoff**.

The following parameters are local to each tap:

- **Delay (X axis):** Delay time of the tap.
- **Gain (Y or Z axis):** Gain of the tap.
- **Cutoff (Z or Y axis):** Band-pass filter cutoff frequency of the tap.

The following parameters have as many independently-modulatable instances as there are taps (see
  [Modulation](../atelier/modulation.md)):

- **Delay scale:** Scales all delay times by the given ratio.
- **Transposition:** Transposes the cutoff frequencies of all taps.

### Global controls

- **Mix:** Crossfades between the dry signal (0%) and the wet signal (100%).
- **Speed:** Transport speed, or how fast the digital "tape" is moving. Affects the speed at which
  the input audio is written to the buffer, as well as the read speed. At speeds < 1x, there are
  less samples to record the incoming audio, so the fidelity is (interestingly) degraded.
- **Rotate:** Rotates the channels in the feedback path (see **Feedback**). At 0%, each channel
  feeds back into itself; at 100%, each channel feeds back into the next one, and the last one feeds
  back into the first, resulting in a generalized ping-pong delay-like effect.

The following parameters have as many independently-modulatable instances as there are taps (see
  [Modulation](../atelier/modulation.md)):

- **Spread:** Channel-locality of each tap. At 0%, each tap outputs only on the channels it is
  assigned to (see the global [Spread](../atelier/multichannel.md#spread) section); at 100%, each
  tap plays all channels in parallel (multi-mono).
- **Gain:** Global gain of all taps
- **Feedback:** Amount of the sum of all taps that is fed back into the input. Careful: with several
  taps, may bloom and provoke loud sounds (even under 100%). To make blooming less aggressive, the
  feedback path includes a soft-clipping stage.
- **Bandpass:** How much band-pass filtering is applied to each tap. The bigger this value, the more
  resonance (or Q-factor) the band-pass filter has. 0 means no filtering at all.
- **Repitch/Fade:** Duration of the tap's playback grains. When >0, a change in delay time will
  result in a crossfade, hence no repitch; at 0, grains are so small that playback is continuous,
  which repitches the input when delay time is changed. Grains are always played at speed 1, so
  lowering **Speed** while this is >0 will result in constant repitching.

## Tips and tricks

### Rhythmic taps

Feed _Time_ some simple rhythmic loop. Introduce a few taps, and arrange them in time so that they
repeat incoming audio in a rhythm of your choosing. Vary their gain and/or cutoff to taste. Tuning
is a precise but rewarding process, as you discover new syncopations and grooves.

### Complex looping

![A screenshot of Time used in a looping configuration](../assets/images/modules/time/time-looper.png)

With a single tap set to a long delay (several seconds), _Time_ can be used as a simple looper: just
crank Feedback to 100% and the material in the buffer will accumulate and repeat indefinitely (this
is Preset 5). Start here: feed some live-played input (voice, guitar, synth) and build layers upon
layers, interacting with past material as if it was another player.

From here, try out a few trics: modulate the delay time slightly for imperfect repetitions, lower **Speed** and/or increase **Bandpass** for generational degradation, add a second tap closeby for complex stereo interplays... the world of delays is your oyster.

### Flangers, choruses and all that

![A screenshot of Time used as a flanger or chorus](../assets/images/modules/time/time-flanger.png)

Flanger, chorus, ensemble, vibrato... all these classic effects are just variants of the same
concept that can easily be recreated with _Time_: short delays (1 to 50 ms) modulated by LFOs.
Mixing the dry and delayed signals carves out pleasing peaks and troughs into the frequency content
of your audio.

An _Agitation_ with 100% **Cyclic** will do the LFO. Add one or several taps around 10 ms, and
modulate their delay times (use **Delay scale**). Increase **Rotate** for stereo width. Increase
**Feedback** to taste. This is your bread-and-butter modulation effect; now explore this space for
effects unheard of: different LFO shapes, audio-rate modulation, degrading with **Speed** and
**Bandpass**, fade instead of repitch...

### Precedence effect

![A screenshot of Time used for Haas or Precedence effect](../assets/images/modules/time/time-precedence.png)

One important cue to the localization of sound is its relative time of arrival: if one ear receives
a sound before the other, the source will appear closer to it. A delay of a couple milliseconds is
enough to trick our brain. It is sometimes called the Haas effect.

Replicate this in _Time_: in stereo and listening on headphones, add two
taps: one at 0 ms, one around 2 ms. Set **Spread** to 0% and **Mix** to 100%. Your input will sound
like it leans to the left, even though the gain of each channel is the same. Vary the right-ear delay time and observe the effect.

Using this creatively is a well of interesting ideas: the same principle with 4 or 8 channels (introducing the same number of taps) creates impossible spatial effects; modulating delay times instantly densifies simple material.

### Reverb tails

As soon as more than one tap is introduced, **Feedback** will not sound like your standard
repetitions. This is because what is fed back is the _sum_ of all individual taps. For instance,
with two taps at 1 and 0.1 seconds respectively and feedback high enough, you will get repetitions
at seconds 0.1, 1, 1.1, 2, 2.1, 2.2, 3, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3 etc.: as the repetitions tail off, they become
"denser" (closer to each other). This can be used at your advantage: with >4 taps and carefully
choosing their times, we can come up with delay tails that quickly densify like reverbs, resulting
in a variety of hybrid reverb/delay effects. This is especially true when delay times are slowly and
slightly modulated, to cut off any resonance buildups.
