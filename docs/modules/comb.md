# Comb

_The resonance treasure trove_

At its heart, the comb filter is arguably the most basic building block of signal processing. Let's
turn it into a creative tool! With a handful of carefully-chosen additions, _Comb_ makes a simple
component into it a fun and versatile physical modeling-inspired instrument with wide sonic
possibilities: realistic string chords & bells, subtle coloring or massive reverberations, all
nuances of wooden, metallic, hollow or full tones... Whether used as an end-of-chain effect or as an
integral synthesis block, _Comb_ is a resonance treasure trove.

## Features

- Bread-and-butter, reinvented: from simple delay line to complex evolving tones
- Multiple, precisely tunable comb filters, with independent control of pitch, decay and gain
- Advanced physical modeling-inspired controls for a wide sonic palette
- Simple and functional user interface

## Context

A comb filter is simply a very short delay with feedback. It realizes what happens in nature when
sound bounces back and forth between two surfaces (standing waves); it is what makes the particular
sound of a physical enclosure (instrument, room...).

As the delay gets shorter, we stop perceiving the repeats as echoes, and start hearing them as
timbre coloration, or as pitch: the shorter the delay, the higher the pitch. If, just like nature
does, we shave off some of the high frequencies at each repeats, the tone gets more mellow over
time, simulating the travel of a displacement along a string. Fed with bursts of noise, this is
often called _Karplus-Strong_ synthesis. _Comb_ takes this classic to new _digital waveguide_
territories with precise control over damping, unique inharmonic warping of partials and pick-up
positioning for interesting phase-cancellation effects.

## Controls

### Cursor area

Click to add a comb filter; double-click a comb filter to remove it. Each comb filter
processes each input channel with the same parameters; they run in parallel and are mixed to the
output.

- **Quantize** button: click to quantize all filter frequencies to the closest semitone.

Each comb filter has three controls:

- **Pitch** (X axis): Resonance frequency, in Hz or MIDI pitch.
- **Decay** (Y axis): Decay time, in seconds, to -60dB. If the decay time is set to more
  than 20 sec, the decay is infinite: fed with a short impulse it will ring forever.
- **Gain** (Z axis): Output gain of the comb filter.

The following parameters have as many independently-modulatable instances as there are comb filters
  (see [Modulation](../atelier/modulation.md)).

- **Transposition:** Transposes all comb filters by a given amount of semitones.
- **Decay scale:** Scales the decay time by the given multiplier.

### Global controls

- **Mix:** Crossfades the dry signal (0%) with the wet signal (100%).

The following parameters have as many independently-modulatable instances as there are comb filters
  (see [Modulation](../atelier/modulation.md)).

- **Spread:** Channel-locality of each comb filter's processes. At 0%, each comb filter processes
  only the channels it is assigned to (see the global [Spread](../atelier/multichannel.md#spread)
  section); at 100%, each comb filter processes all channels in parallel (multi-mono).
- **Gain:** Output gain of all comb filters. Combined with the gain of each filter.
- **Damp:** Amount of damping, or how much high frequencies (higher than the resonance) are
  attenuated as decay progresses. At 0% no or very minimal damping is applied, leading to a metallic
  tone; at 100%, the harmonic content of the input is immediately attenuated into a sine at the
  resonance frequency.
- **Warp:** Warps the resonant partials, from purely harmonic (0%) to weirdly dissonant. It works by
  introducing a complex all-pass filter in the feedback loop, delaying some frequencies more than
  others at each round-trip.
- **Phase:** Controls where in the delay loop the output signal is picked up, i.e. only at the end
  (0%) or in the middle as the sum of the forward and backward direction (100%). At 100%, phase
  cancellations are such that only odd harmonics ring.
- **Predelay:** Introduces a short delay before the input signal hits the comb filter loop.

## Tips and tricks

### Noise bursts

_Comb_ shines with transient-rich input material. Using [Gen](gen.md) and [Peak](peak.md), make
short bursts of noise. Follow with a single comb filter at a relatively high **Decay** (>1s); put
**Mix** at 100%, and adjust **Damp** and the noise's length and color to taste to get a wide variety
of plucked strings, glassy tone, bell sounds etc.

### Strummed chords

Building on the previous tip, add more comb filters at different frequencies to make a chord. Now,
put **Predelay** around 50ms, and modulate it slightly with a slow [_Agitation_](agitation.md). Every
filter will get its own randomly-evolving predelay, resulting in a "strumming" effect, as if strings
were not plucked all at the same time.

### Infinite decay

When **Decay** is set to more than 20 sec and **Warp** is 0%, decay is _infinite_: any short-lived
input will resonate (almost) forever. Fed with an initial short signal, this can be useful to
generate held tones, drones or textures.

!!! note

    Infinite decay works only if either **Damp** or **Warp** is 0% (one of the two).

### Crude reverb

Early digital reverberation units (now refered to as [Schr√∂der
reverbs](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6161610)) worked by simply feeding the input signal
through several dampened comb filters in parallel. With **Mix** around 20%, make a cloud of a dozen
comb filters with frequencies around 20-50 Hz (around the ear's integration time). Set **Damp**
around 20% will get you a relatively natural reverberation, where the global decay time controls the
reverb time. Adjust **Predelay** to taste; slightly and slowly agitating **Transpose** will help
attenuating some the metallic resoance.

### At time rate

A comb filter is a very short delay... but _Comb_ also supports longer delay! These will be heard as
normal repetitions, so you can use _Comb_ as (a set of) regular delays, with some twists. Add a
single comb filter towards the lower frequencies, and put **Transposition** all the way down; you
can reach delay times up to about half a second (2 Hz). **Decay** then controls the delay feedback,
and the other controls well... you will have to experiment for yourself! Remember that everything
(especially frequency/delay time) is modulatable.
