A pitch shifter changes the pitch of a sound without changing its duration. On the surface, this is what _Pitch_ is: a bank of pitch shifters combined with delays, placed on a 2D surface. But rather than delivering just this, _Pitch_ breaks the concept apart and exposes it, piece by piece: granular playback into a buffer with variable speed, adjustable correlation detection, wide range of grain size...

Use it for old tricks (tuning or harmonize, thickening), or explore a wealth of novel ideas (very long or very short grains, disable correlation, modulate anything): _Pitch_ is more than just what its name suggests.

## Features

- Up to 8 pitch shifters/delays, placed on an intuitive 2D surface
- Transpose by a wide range range: from +48 semitones to -âˆž
- Delay by up to 10 sec
- Freeze the buffer and scrub inside it

## Context

## Controls

### Cursor area

- **Quantize** button: click to quantize all pitches to the closest semitone.
- **Clear all buffers** button: click to silence all delay buffers

The following parameters are local to each pitch shifter:

- **Delay (X axis):** Pitch shifter delay time.
- **Pitch (Y axis):** Pitch shifting amount. Sets the grains playback rate relative to normal rate.
- **Gain (Z axis):** Pitch shifter gain.
- **Freeze** button: Stops feeding audio into this pitch shifter buffer, and read current content in-place.

The following parameters have as many independently-modulatable instances as there are pitch shifters (see [Modulation](../atelier/modulation.md)):

- **Freeze** button: Inverts the Freeze state of all pitch shifters (see local **Freeze** parameter).
- **Delay ratio:** Scales all delays by the given ratio.
- **Rate:** Scales all pitches by the given ratio. Negative ratios mean reverse grain playback.

### Global controls

- **Mix:** Crossfades between the dry (0%) and the wet signal (100%).

The following parameters have as many independently-modulatable instances as there are pitch shifters (see [Modulation](../atelier/modulation.md)):

- **Spread:** Channel-locality of each pitch shifter. At 0%, each pitch shifter processes only the channels it is assigned to (see the global [Spread](../atelier/multichannel.md#spread) section); at 100%, all pitch shifters process all channels in parallel (multi-mono).
- **Gain:** Global gain of all pitch shifters.
- **Feedback:** How much of each pitch shifter's output is reinjected into its input. Feedback is local to each pitch shifter
- **Window:** Duration of the pitch-shifted grains.
- **Detect:** Precision of the correlation detection. At 100%, a correction is applied to each grain starting position to correlate better with the currently playing grain to avoid phase cancellations. At 0%, this correction is disabled, resulting in an amplitude modulation-type effect.
- **Rotate:** Rotates the channels in the feedback path. At 0%, each channel's feedback paths is completely independent; at 100%, each channel feeds back into its successor and the last one feeds back into the first, resulting in a generalized ping-pong delay-like effect.
