A pitch shifter changes the pitch of a sound without changing its duration. On the surface, this is what _Pitch_ is: a bank of pitch shifters combined with delays, placed on a convenient 2D surface. But rather than delivering just this, _Pitch_ deconstructs the concept and exposes it, piece by piece. Used for classic pitch tricks or to explore a wealth of novel ideas, _Pitch_ is more than just what its name suggests.

## Features

- Up to 8 pitch shifters/granular delays, placed on an intuitive 2D surface
- Wide transposition & delay range: from +48 semitones to -âˆž, up to 10 seconds delay
- Freeze function to scrub inside buffer
- Adjustable window size & correlation detection

## Context

Feed sound into _Pitch_, click to add a pitch shifter: the sound is delayed and transposed.

But what actually happens is not magic: the input is recorded into a buffer, and two overlapping play heads continuously read small grains of sound around the cursor (the delay time), at a speed proportional to the transposition required. Basic pitch shifting is just this: playing small overlapping grains of the input sound at speeds different than the recording speed!

Combined with grain position adjustment thanks to correlation detection, this overlap/add technique is the archetype of pitch shifting algorithm ([_WSOLA_](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/319366)), and can lead to

works especially well if the size of the grains stay in a certain goldilocks zone (around 20-100 ms), and if the grain positions are automatically adjusted to avoid phase cancellation (by measuring their mutual correlation). Otherwise, artifacts like transient doubling or amplitude modulation start to be heard.

_Pitch_ default to these conditions, but allows to break free from them: with a wide range of grain sizes (from 4 ms to 2 seconds) and adjustable correlation detection, you are free to use it orthodoxically, or to play with the artifacts themselves.

## Controls

### Cursor area

Click to add a pitch shifter; double-click a pitch shifter to remove it. Each pitch shifter runs in parallel with its own buffer; they are then mixed to the output.

- **Quantize** button: click to quantize all pitches to the closest semitone.
- **Clear all buffers** button: click to silence all delay buffers

The following parameters are local to each pitch shifter:

- **Delay (X axis):** Pitch shifter delay time.
- **Pitch (Y axis):** Pitch shifting amount. Sets the grains playback rate relative to normal rate.
- **Gain (Z axis):** Pitch shifter gain.
- **Freeze** button: Stops feeding audio into this pitch shifter buffer, and read current content in-place.

The following parameters have as many independently-modulatable instances as there are pitch shifters (see [Modulation](../atelier/modulation.md)):

- **Freeze** button: Inverts the Freeze state of all pitch shifters (see local **Freeze** parameter).
- **Delay ratio:** Scales all delays by the given ratio.
- **Rate:** Scales all pitches by the given ratio. Negative ratios mean reverse grain playback.

### Global controls

- **Mix:** Crossfades between the dry (0%) and the wet signal (100%).

The following parameters have as many independently-modulatable instances as there are pitch shifters (see [Modulation](../atelier/modulation.md)):

- **Spread:** Channel-locality of each pitch shifter. At 0%, each pitch shifter processes only the channels it is assigned to (see the global [Spread](../atelier/multichannel.md#spread) section); at 100%, all pitch shifters process all channels in parallel (multi-mono).
- **Gain:** Global gain of all pitch shifters.
- **Feedback:** How much of each pitch shifter's output is reinjected into its input. Feedback is local to each pitch shifter
- **Window:** Duration of the pitch-shifted grains.
- **Detect:** Precision of the correlation detection. At 100%, a correction is applied to each grain starting position to correlate better with the currently playing grain to avoid phase cancellations. At 0%, this correction is disabled, resulting in an amplitude modulation-type effect.
- **Rotate:** Rotates the channels in the feedback path. At 0%, each channel's feedback paths is completely independent; at 100%, each channel feeds back into its successor and the last one feeds back into the first, resulting in a generalized ping-pong delay-like effect.
